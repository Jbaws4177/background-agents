## ⚙️ System requirements

Your computer needs to meet these basic standards to run the software:

* Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11.
* Memory: 4 gigabytes of RAM or more.
* Storage: 500 megabytes of free disk space.
* Processor: A dual-core processor with 2.0 gigahertz speed.
* Internet: An active connection to download updates.

## 🚀 Setting up the application

Once you install the program, you must configure it to perform your desired tasks. Follow this guide to initialize the agent system.

### First boot
When you open the application for the first time, you will see a simple control panel. This panel shows the status of your agents. Locate the "New Agent" button in the top menu. This action opens a setup wizard. The wizard asks you to choose a name for your agent and define its start time.

### Defining tasks
The system uses simple text files to know which tasks to perform. You can create a script file in a folder of your choice. Point the application to this folder using the Settings menu. The application watches this folder and executes any script found inside. 

### Managing agents
The main dashboard lists all active agents. Each entry has a play button and a pause button. Click the pause button to stop an agent without removing it from the system. Click the play button to resume its schedule. The logs section at the bottom of the window records every action the agent takes. Check these logs if a task fails or does not trigger correctly.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting common issues

Most problems have simple solutions. Review these tips if you encounter errors during operation.

### Application does not open
If the application fails to launch, try restarting your computer. Check your antivirus settings to ensure it does not block the software. Sometimes a security scan prevents new programs from starting until you give them permission.

### Tasks do not trigger
Verify the file paths in your settings menu. The software cannot find files if they live in a restricted system folder. Move your scripts to a folder in your Documents directory. Ensure that you saved the script files with the correct format.

### High memory usage
If your computer feels slow, check the number of active agents. Running ten agents at the exact same time requires more memory. Stagger your agent schedules so that they run at different intervals. 

## 🛡️ Privacy and safety

The application runs locally on your machine. No data leaves your computer unless you explicitly configure the agent to send information to a third-party service. The software does not store your private credentials. It simply executes the instructions contained in your script files. We recommend that you review your script files before adding them to the agent folder to ensure they perform only the actions you intend.

## 📝 Configuration details

You can adjust how the background agents look and behave. Open the Settings tab to change the following:

* Theme: Select a light or dark interface.
* Updates: Toggle automatic checks for new versions.
* Notifications: Allow the system to send alerts when a task finishes.

The software stores these preferences in a local folder. You can reset these preferences to the default values by deleting the configuration file in the application data folder.

## 📁 File structure

When you install the software, it generates a set of folders:

* /bin: Contains the core executable files.
* /logs: Stores the history of all agent activities.
* /scripts: The location where you should store your task files.
* /config: Holds your preferences and settings.

Do not move or rename the /bin folder. Doing so will stop the application from working. You may reorganize the /scripts folder as you see fit.
